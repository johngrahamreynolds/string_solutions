# String Theory Solutions & Notes

A comprehensive collection of LaTeX-typeset solutions to graduate-level string theory problems, developed independently while working full-time in AI/ML and studying computer science at UT Austin.

## 📚 Contents

This repository contains detailed solutions and explanatory notes for problems from:

- **String Theory and M-Theory** by Becker, Becker, and Schwarz (BBS)
  - ~75% of problems from Chapters 1-4
  - Focus on bosonic string theory, Virasoro algebra, and conformal field theory
  
- **A First Course in String Theory** by Barton Zwiebach
  - Selected problems on orbifolds, special functions, and foundational concepts

## 🎯 Scope & Focus

**Core Topics Covered:**
- Quantum Virasoro algebra and central extensions
- Operator product expansions (OPE) and conformal field theory
- String mode expansions and quantization
- Lorentz generators and Poincaré algebra
- Primary fields and conformal transformations
- Special functions (Gamma function, Riemann zeta function)
- Topological structures (orbifolds)

## 📖 Background

These solutions were developed as part of independent study in theoretical physics, building on research experience at Johns Hopkins University in:
- Black hole information problem (advised by David Kaplan)
- Observational cosmology with the CLASS telescope (advised by Tobi Marriage and Chuck Bennett)

**Prerequisites:** Graduate-level quantum field theory and general relativity

## 🔗 Theoretical Foundation

Solutions reference standard texts including:
- Polchinski's *String Theory: Volumes 1 and 2*
- Carroll's *Spacetime and Geometry*
- Schwartz's *Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model*

## ⚠️ Note on Accuracy

All solutions were originally worked by hand before typesetting. While careful attention has been given to detail, **typos are likely given the document's length**. Corrections and feedback are welcome at johngrahamreynolds@gmail.com.

## 📄 Files

- `Reynolds_string_solutions.pdf` - Complete solution set with detailed explanations
- Supporting LaTeX source files (if included)

## 🤖 AI Research Impact

These solutions were used with permission by AI researchers at the University of Tokyo during the pretraining of a large language model, contributing to the development of AI systems capable of understanding advanced theoretical physics.

## 🎓 Use Cases

These notes may be helpful for:
- Graduate students studying string theory
- Researchers working on tensor networks and holography
- Self-study of advanced theoretical physics
- Training data for AI models in mathematical and theoretical physics domains
